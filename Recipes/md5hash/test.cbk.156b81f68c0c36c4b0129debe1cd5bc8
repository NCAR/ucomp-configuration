#  UCOMP Cookbooks now support comment lines anything that starts with a 
# <- Hash will be ignored by the UCoMP software!!.
#
#  We have also implemented hierarchical looping; so if cookbooks
#  need to repeat a series of reticles multiple times we can use a 
#  FOR/ENDFOR loop instead of copy/pasta
#
#  The syntax of the FOR/ENDFOR is a block that starts with 
#  line "FOR X" and ends with a line "ENDFOR".  Where X is the number
#  of times to repeat that block.
#
#  The FOR loops be nested such that the following block:
#
#  FOR 2
#  recipe1
#  FOR 2
#  recipe2
#  ENDFOR
#  ENDFOR
#  will produce the effective cookbook:
#
#  recipe1
#  recipe2
#  recipe2
#  recipe1
#  recipe2
#  recipe2
#
# We also added support of Keyworks that will be pass everything to the right of the keyword into the fits header. At this point the proposed keywords are 
#  AUTHOR         #### Person who created or maybe did major edits this cookbook
#  DATE  	      #### Date cookbook was created or edited.
#  DESCRIPTION    #### Description of the program to be run. Goals Etc.
# 
#  The values associated with these keywords will be limited to the fits standard (80 chars?).
#  If it is desirable to have long descriptions the framework can easily be extended to support
#  DESCRIPTION2, DESCRIPTION3, or any other interesting keywords that the cookbook author would like 
#  to pass on to the fits user. 
#

#
#  Below you will find an example of the ComP cookbook synotpic-000008.ckb modified to use the 
#  new looping keywords.
