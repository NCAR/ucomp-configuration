## It looks like the camera config needs to change when we swap cameras.
## To build a camera config open up XCAP get the camera settings tweaked to be 
## the desired settings.  Then go PCXCI->PCXCI Export Video Setup  and use the 
## dialog box to create a new fmt file for the new cameras.  Then edit this
## config tile to point at the newly created video format.
